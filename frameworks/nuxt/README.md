# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).

# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

# LAYOUTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Application Layouts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/views#layouts).

# MIDDLEWARE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application middleware.
Middleware let you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware).

# PAGES

This directory contains your Application Views and Routes.
The framework reads all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and creates the router of your application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing).

# PLUGINS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains Javascript plugins that you want to run before mounting the root Vue.js application.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/plugins).

# STATIC

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your static files.
Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.
Thus you'd want to delete this README.md before deploying to production.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).

# STORE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).
